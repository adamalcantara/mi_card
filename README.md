# Mi Card

## Description

A simple application written with Dart and Flutter to create a virtual business card. In building this application, I furthered my knowledge of Flutter and its widgets, including Card, Padding, ListTile, SafeArea, and Circle Avatar. I also learned how to implement custom fonts and icons in a Flutter application.
